##  Installation

*As some features are implemented in a way to fit the very specific needs and use cases of the Democraciv Discord, it is not recommended 
to run the bot yourself as you might run into unexpected errors. Instead, invite the bot to your server with this 
 [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=486971089222631455&scope=bot&permissions=2081418487).*

After installing all the dependencies, create a `token.py` in the config folder.

The file should look like this:

```
# Token
TOKEN = ""
TIMEZONEDB_API_KEY = ""
YOUTUBE_DATA_V3_API_KEY = ""

# Reddit
REDDIT_USERNAME = ""
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = ""
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN = ""

# Twitch Config
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID = ""
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
TWITCH_OAUTH_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN = ""

# PostgreSQL config
POSTGRESQL_USER = ""
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD = ""
POSTGRESQL_HOST = ""
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE = ""
```

Add the token of your Discord App, your Twitch Helix API authorization if you enabled the Twitch module, your API key for the 
YouTube Data v3 API if you enabled YouTube notifications, your TimeZoneDB API Key, and your PostgreSQL configuration like above. 

Once `token.py` is set up, take a look at `config.py` in the same folder and adjust everything to your needs.

After you've done all that, run `bot.py`.

####  Database

This bot needs a PostgreSQL database to run. To install and configure PostgreSQL, head [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).
 The bot was tested with PostgreSQL 9.6, 11.5 and 12.1, everything in between should work.


You only need to create an empty database, the bot will then fill that with tables on startup.


####  Twitch 

If you want to use the Twitch announcements feature, you have to create an app [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). 
Then, copy its Client ID and the Client Secret and add it to the `token.py` in the config folder. It's strongly recommended to also
[obtain an OAuth app access token](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth#oauth-client-credentials-flow)
 and add it to `token.py` too. While the bot will obtain the app access token itself (if not provided) via the
Client ID and Client Secret, the token will not persist bot restarts, resulting in useless API requests to the Twitch API for 
a new token. 

App Access Tokens expire after around 58 days. If that happens, the bot will obtain a new one and notify you to replace that new token
in `token.py`.

You can configure everything else that is Twitch related in `config.py`.


####  Reddit 

Notifications for new posts from a subreddit are enabled by default, but can be disabled in the `config.py`. Unlike the
Twitch Notification module, we don't need to register an API key for Reddit.

If you want to make the bot post the weekly Starboard to a subreddit, you do have to provide the client ID, client secret and 
a **refresh token** (not application token!) of your reddit app. Follow this [guide](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2) on how to get these. 
Make sure your refresh token has the `submit` scope. 

You can configure everything else that is Reddit related in `config.py`.


####  YouTube 

Notifications for new video uploads and livestreams from a YouTube channel are enabled by default, but can be disabled in the `config.py`. You'll need
an API key for the YouTube Data v3 API from Google. [This](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) has more information on how to get one.

You can configure everything else that is YouTube related in `config.py`.


#### Google Cloud Platform

The Bot uses the Google Apps Script API to remotely execute the Apps Script that generates the voting form as a Google Form for
legislative sessions. You need to create a Google Cloud Platform project and then create OAuth credentials for that project. Download the credentials as JSON from your Google Cloud Platform Console
and put that file to the filepath that is specified as `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE` in `config.py`. The file in `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PLATFORM_CLIENT_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_FILE` 
will be created by the bot itself. The first time this is run, **it will open your web browser** to create OAuth Access Tokens based on your Google Account.
 
The Apps Script must be in the same Google Cloud Platform project as the OAuth credentials for the caller. 

This setup is a bit more complex than the other APIs. Follow these guides: 

*   [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
*   [Google Apps Script API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/concepts)
*   [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/quickstart/python)
*   [REST Reference](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/reference/rest)
